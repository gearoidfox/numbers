Print terms in the fibonacci sequence up the largest term we can store in 128 bits (x86_64/Linux):
       
    make
    ./xfib
    

Be ~~boring~~ sensible and using a language that's portable and has arbitrary precision integer arithmetic: 

    perl6 fibonacci.p6

Calculate a few terms in PostScript and draw a picture:

    gv fib.ps
